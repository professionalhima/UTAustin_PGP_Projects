        * Covers LR, Decision Trees, Bagging, Random Forests, Boosting Algorithms. 
        * Because of class imbalance, applied SMOTE
        * Classification report and confusion matrix analysis
        * Feature Selection / Elemination - Used Recursive Feature Elemination and checked model performances for various models
          - Best Model is Gradient Boosting with 89% f1, 89% precision and 90% recall
