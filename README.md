## Projects done
**1. Foundation for AIML - MovieLens Data Exploration**
   - Covers Descriptive Statistics, Exploratory Data Analysis covering Visualizations too
      - **Project link:** [MovieLens Data Exploration](https://github.com/professionalhima/UTAustin_PGP_Projects/blob/main/MovieLens%20Data%20Exploration/MovieLensProject1_Solutions_HimajaM.ipynb)
         - The GroupLens Research Project is a research group in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Minnesota. The data is widely used for collaborative filtering and other filtering solutions. However, we will be using this data to act as a means to demonstrate our skill in using Python to “play” with data.
         - **Learning Outcomes:**
         	- Exploratory Data Analysis
         	- Visualization using Python
         	- Pandas – groupby, merging
